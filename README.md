Scikit-Learn
Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library for Python.
Provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including:
Classification: Identifying which category an object belongs to. Example: Spam detection
Regression: Predicting a continuous variable based on relevant independent variables. Example: Stock price predictions
Clustering: Automatic grouping of similar objects into different clusters. Example: Customer segmentation
Dimensionality Reduction: Seek to reduce the number of input variables in training data by preserving the salient relationships in the data
Features various algorithms like support vector machine, random forests, and k-neighbours.
Supports Python numerical and scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy.
Some popular groups of models provided by scikit-learn include:

### Clustering: Group unlabeled data such as KMeans.
Cross Validation: Estimate the performance of supervised models on unseen data.
Datasets: for test datasets and for generating datasets with specific properties for investigating model behavior.
Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce the number of attributes in data for summarization, visualization and feature selection such as Principal component analysis.
Ensemble Methods: Combine the predictions of multiple supervised models.
Feature Extraction: Define attributes in image and text data.
Feature Selection: Identify meaningful attributes from which to create supervised models.
Parameter Tuning: Get the most out of supervised models.
Manifold Learning: Summarize and depicting complex multi-dimensional data.
Supervised Models: A vast array not limited to generalized linear models, discriminate analysis, naive bayes, lazy methods, neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees.
Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: âˆ’ They include clustering, factor analysis, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), unsupervised neural networks.
